- **Pandas**: (Optional) For handling and structuring scraped data in tables and CSV files.

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install pandas
```

> **Note**: `pandas` is only necessary if you wish to manipulate or analyze the scraped data.

## 💡 How It Works

This scraper is simple yet effective. Here’s how it works, step-by-step:

### 🎯 1. Target the URL
We begin by specifying the **IPL Auction 2024** webpage URL. The scraper knows exactly where to look for the treasure.

### 🌐 2. Fetch the Webpage
Next, using the **requests** library, we send an HTTP request to fetch the entire webpage's HTML content. Think of this as collecting the raw ingredients needed to extract data.

### 🧩 3. Parse with BeautifulSoup
The HTML content is handed over to **BeautifulSoup**, which elegantly parses the webpage, navigating through its structure. It transforms messy code into clean, digestible data.

### ✂️ 4. Data Extraction
Now comes the fun part! The scraper extracts specific data — whether it’s player names, teams, or bid amounts. It grabs the data you want with precision.

### 🗄️ 5. Optional Data Handling
If you plan to analyze the data or visualize it, use **Pandas** to organize the data into rows and columns, or export it into a CSV file for easy use in analysis tools.
